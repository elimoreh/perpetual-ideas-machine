TITLE: Self-Repairing Composite Material with Embedded Microcapsules

ABSTRACT: A composite material containing embedded microcapsules, designed to rupture when the material undergoes significant strain or damage, thus releasing a repair agent. This material significantly extends the lifespan and maintains the structural integrity of mechanical components.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The composite material is a resin-based matrix that incorporates microcapsules of approximately 0.1 to 1 mm in diameter, filled with a repair agent and a catalyst. The repair agent is designed to polymerize upon contact with the catalyst. The microcapsules are evenly distributed throughout the matrix using a high-shear mixing technique. The resulting composite material has a tensile strength and fracture toughness comparable to that of standard resins used in the mechanical components.

The repair agent consists of a monomer such as dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) and a catalyst such as Grubbs' catalyst. The microcapsules are made of a polymer shell, which is designed to rupture upon significant strain or impact, releasing the repair agent and catalyst into the damaged area. The released monomer polymerizes and fills the crack or void, restoring the material's structural integrity.

CLAIMS:
1. The inclusion of repair agent-filled microcapsules embedded within the composite material is a novel application of self-healing technology in the field of mechanical engineering.
2. The use of a high-shear mixing technique to distribute the microcapsules evenly is an innovative production method, improving the material’s performance and reliability.
3. The specific combination of DCPD as the repair agent and Grubbs' catalyst enable a swift and effective self-healing process, making the material highly adaptive to various damage scenarios.

ENABLEMENT: To produce the self-repairing composite material, prepare a mixture of repair agent and catalyst in equal proportions. Create a suspension of the microcapsules in the resin base, ensuring an even distribution. Pour the mixture into a mould of the desired mechanical component shape and let it cure at room temperature. The mechanical component can then be finished and polished as needed.

In the event of damage, the strain or impact fractures the microcapsules, releasing the repair agent and catalyst. The catalyst triggers a polymerization reaction with the repair agent, which then solidifies and fills the existing cracks or voids, essentially "healing" the material. The repair process can occur multiple times, extending the component's lifespan significantly.
