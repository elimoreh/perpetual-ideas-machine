TITLE: Self-Regulating, Energy-Efficient Heat Exchanger

ABSTRACT: The Self-Regulating, Energy-Efficient Heat Exchanger is an advanced thermal device that automatically adjusts its heat transfer rate based on the temperature of the working fluids. The invention provides an optimal heat transfer efficiency, reducing energy usage significantly.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The self-regulating, energy-efficient heat exchanger comprises a series of interconnected plates and tubes, built from high thermal conductivity materials, such as copper or aluminium. The heat exchanger utilizes phase change materials (PCMs) incorporated within its structure, providing a unique property of adapting to the temperature variations of the working fluids. 

The dimensions and the number of plates and tubes used depend on the heat transfer requirement. The tubes have a diameter of approximately 1-4 cm and are spaced around 0.5-2 cm apart, for optimal heat transfer. The plates incorporate pockets filled with PCM that will change its state with respect to the temperature changes. 

The PCM selection is according to the phase transition temperature close to the operating temperature range, varying from organic to inorganic or eutectic compounds. The heat exchanger also includes temperature sensors and a microprocessor responsible for monitoring and controlling the heat transfer rate.

CLAIMS: 

1. The application of phase change materials (PCMs) in the structure of the heat exchanger allowing self-regulation of thermal transfer in response to fluid temperatures.
2. An automated monitoring and controlling system that optimizes heat transfer rate based on real-time temperature readings.
3. The ability of the system to reduce energy consumption due to its adaptive heat transfer capabilities.
4. The combination of high thermal conductivity materials and PCMs to improve heat transfer efficiency.

ENABLEMENT: 

Firstly, the high conductive plates and tubes should be prepared according to the desired dimensions. Pockets on the plates are then created to retain the PCM. Thereafter, the PCM is filled into these pockets. The plates are structurally designed to ensure efficient heat transfer and PCM containment. 

The tubes are then attached to these plates ensuring secure and leak-proof connections. Then the temperature sensors are attached at appropriate locations across the exchanger where they have access to accurate temperature readings of the working fluids.

Then, a microprocessor is programmed to analyze these temperature readings and control the heat exchange process. Finally, the system is tested for any fluid leakages, followed by its thermal performance tests. 

Once successful, it can be deployed in any system where heat exchange is necessary – HVAC systems, industrial processes, vehicle thermal management systems, etc. The system automatically adjusts the heat transfer rate based on the temperature of the working fluids, thereby saving energy and maintaining an optimal working condition.
