TITLE: Refrigerant Recapture and Purification System (RRPS)

ABSTRACT: The invention is a one-stop system designed to recapture and purify refrigerant, reducing environmental impact and improving efficiency in HVAC units. RRPS is unique in its ability to perform both functions in one compact unit.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The Refrigerant Recapture and Purification System (RRPS) is a compact unit that consists of three primary sections: the refrigerant recapture unit, the purification system, and the reservoir. The recapture unit connects directly to any HVAC unit and is made of lightweight, but sturdy aluminum. The purification system, on the other hand, relies on a multi-stage filtration process that includes a first stage particulate filter made from Polypropylene fibers to remove solid contaminants, followed by a second stage chemical filter using activated carbon to remove any gaseous contaminants. The final stage of purification involves a moisture removal process using a silica gel desiccant. The purified refrigerant is stored in the reservoir, a stainless steel container with a capacity of 20 liters.

The system is powered by a 240VAC, 50Hz supply and is designed to handle different refrigerants like R-410A, R-22, and R-134a. Overall dimensions of the RRPS are 80cm x 60cm x 50cm, and it weighs approximately 45kg.

CLAIMS:
1. Integrated unit for refrigerant recapture and purification reduces the need for separate systems, saving space and cost.
2. Multi-stage purification process using a combination of particulate, chemical, and desiccant filters for improved refrigerant purity.
3. Wide range of compatibility with different types of refrigerants.
4. Lightweight and compact design enables easy transportation and installation.

ENABLEMENT: To use the RRPS, connect it directly to an HVAC unit using the provided adapter. Once powered on, it starts recapturing the refrigerant. The refrigerant enters the multi-stage filtration system, where solids, gas contaminants and moisture are removed. After purification, it is stored in the reservoir. The system includes an interactive interface that allows users to monitor refrigerant levels, filter status and overall system health. When the reservoir is full, it can be drained by connecting a refrigerant container to the outlet port. During maintenance, the filters can be replaced by unscrewing the old filter cartridges and inserting new ones.
