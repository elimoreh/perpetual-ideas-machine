TITLE: Advanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production Reactor Using Modified TiO2 Nanocomposites

ABSTRACT: A novel, high-efficiency photocatalytic reactor design, optimized for hydrogen production from water using UV-responsive TiO2 nanocomposites. The design incorporates several innovative modifications to enhance light absorption and charge separation, thereby, increasing photocatalytic performance and hydrogen yield.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The reactor comprises of an inner and an outer cylindrical chamber made of quartz, having the inner cylinder serving as the photocatalytic bed housing a slurry of modified TiO2 nanocomposites, and the outer cylinder designed for increased UV light supply. The nanocomposites are modifications of TiO2 nanoparticles (with a size range of 20-30 nm), where TiO2 is doped with non-metal elements such as Nitrogen (N) and Fluorine (F), which enhances light absorption breadth into the visible range, and boosts photocatalytic performance. 

An array of UV-LEDs is submerged in a UV-transparent coolant housed in the outer cylinder to provide UV illumination and control the temperature of the system. The design also includes a gas collection system at the top of the reactor to accumulate and quantify the generated hydrogen gas. All components are scaled to fit within a 2-ft long and 6-inch diameter cylindrical system, allowing for modularity and ease of scale-up.

CLAIMS: 

1. Use of doped TiO2 nanocomposites to broaden light absorption and improve charge separation, thereby enhancing photocatalytic performance and hydrogen yield.

2. A dual-cylinder design that maximises UV illumination while maintaining precise control over the system's temperature.

3. Implementation of an in-situ gas collection mechanism for continuous accumulation, and quantification of the produced hydrogen.

4. Compact and modular design, suitable for scale-up and capable of fitting within various industrial settings.

ENABLEMENT: To construct the reactor, start by procuring a quartz dual-cylinder setup with prescribed dimensions. Prepare the modified TiO2 nanocomposites by doping TiO2 nanoparticles with N and F through a heat treatment process and subsequent cooling. Fill the inner cylinder with a slurry of the prepared nanocomposites and water. 

Place the UV-LED array within the outer cylinder, ensuring they are submerged in a UV-transparent coolant (like water). Connect the UV-LEDs to an appropriate power source and ensure their operational integrity. 

Attach a gas collection system to the top of the inner cylinder to capture and quantify the produced hydrogen. To operate, power on the UV-LEDs and allow the system to run under standard atmospheric conditions. Monitor the gas collection system to gauge the hydrogen production rate.
