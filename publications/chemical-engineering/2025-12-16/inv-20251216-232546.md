TITLE: Automated Multi-phase Extraction System for Complex Mixtures 

ABSTRACT: An automated chemical extraction system designed for complex, multiple-phase mixtures. The system offers increased efficiency in component separation, high-precision control, and a time-saving solution for processing of mixtures with multiple phases.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The invention comprises an automated extraction unit, consisting of a series of interconnected chambers (each having a volume between 1 and 100 liters, depending on scale of operation), a high-precision pump system, a computer-controlled regulation system, and a real-time analysis system. Each chamber is designed to handle different phases of a mixture (e.g., gas, liquid, solid), where the computer-controlled regulation system maintains specific and optimal conditions for each phase (temperature, pressure, pH, and so on). The high-precision pump system ensures efficient and controlled transfer of mixtures between chambers, while the real-time analysis system monitors the extraction process in each chamber, providing immediate quantitative and qualitative analysis.

Each chamber is made of a corrosion-resistant material, preferably stainless steel, equipped with heating/cooling jackets for temperature control, and sensors to measure pressure, pH and temperature. The pump system consists of a series of high-precision transfer pumps, capable of variable speeds to handle different flow rates, and made from a chemically inert material to prevent contamination.

The real-time analysis system employs a combination of chromatography, mass spectrometry, and infrared spectroscopy for precise compositional analysis. The computer-controlled regulation system manages all operating conditions based on predefined algorithms, and it can adapt on the go based on the feedback from the real-time analysis system.

CLAIMS:

1. The invention claims an automated process for efficient extraction from multiple-phase mixtures with real-time feedback and control.
2. The use of a computer-controlled regulation system that maintains optimal extraction conditions based on the real-time compositional analysis.
3. The design and integration of high-precision pump systems, capable of handling different flow rates, ensuring controlled transfer between chambers.

ENABLEMENT:

1. Assemble each extraction chamber with temperature, pressure and pH sensors, and heating/cooling jackets.
2. Set up the high-precision pump system to connect all chambers.
3. Integrate the computer-controlled regulation system with all the chambers and the pump system.
4. Configure the real-time analysis system with the regulation system to provide continuous feedback.
5. Load the mixture into the first chamber and initiate the automated extraction process through the computer-controlled regulation system.
6. Monitor the extraction process and adjust settings if necessary based on the real-time analysis data.
7. Once the extraction is complete in one chamber, transfer the partially-extracted mixture to the next chamber using the pump system.
8. Repeat the process until extraction is complete in all chambers.
