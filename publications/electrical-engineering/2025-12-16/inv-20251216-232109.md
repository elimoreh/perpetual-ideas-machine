# Electrical Engineering Invention

TITLE: Wire-Free Power Transfer Integrated Lighting Fixture

ABSTRACT: The invention introduces a wire-free power transfer integrated lighting fixture that harnesses the functionality of resonant inductive coupling. This technology enables the transmission of electrical power to electronic devices, resulting in a cordless environment increasing safety and reducing clutter.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The invention involves an integrated lighting fixture comprising of an input power source, a primary coil, a secondary coil and an LED lighting unit. The primary coil (10 cm in diameter, made of copper wire) is connected to the input power source via an AC-DC converter and a resonant capacitor. The secondary coil, identical to the primary coil, is connected to the LED lighting unit via another DC-AC converter.

The input power source provides alternating current which is converted to direct current by the AC-DC converter. The DC current charges the resonant capacitor which is connected to the primary coil. The primary coil, when charged, creates a magnetic field due to the resonant frequency of the resonant capacitor.

The secondary coil is specifically designed to resonate at this frequency, thus when positioned within the field of the primary coil, it absorbs energy from the magnetic field. This energy is then converted back into an alternating current by the second DC-AC converter and used to power the LED lighting unit. The fixture is enclosed within a thermoplastic housing to ensure safety.

CLAIMS: 
1. The novel integration of resonant inductive coupling into a lighting fixture allowing for wire-free power transmission to the LED lighting unit.
2. The application of a resonant capacitor connected to the primary coil for creating a magnetic field.
3. The use of a secondary coil designed to resonate at the specific frequency of the magnetic field, thus absorbing its energy.
4. The use of a thermoplastic housing for enclosing the fixture to ensure safety.

ENABLEMENT: 
1. Start by assembling the primary circuit which consists of the power source, the AC-DC converter, the resonant capacitor and the primary coil. Ensure all connections are secure.
2. Assemble the secondary circuit which consists of the secondary coil, the DC-AC converter and the LED lighting unit. Make sure that the secondary coil resonates at the same frequency as the resonant capacitor.
3. Position the secondary coil within the magnetic field of the primary coil, ensuring there's no physical contact.
4. Enclose the entire assembly within the thermoplastic housing, ensuring all circuits are secure and correctly positioned.
5. Test the functionality of the integrated lighting fixture by powering the input source. The LED light should lighten up if power transfer is successful. Adjust the positioning of the coils if necessary.
