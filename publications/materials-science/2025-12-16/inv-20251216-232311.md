TITLE: Shape-memory Alloy (SMA) Reinforced Concrete 

ABSTRACT: A novel approach to concrete reinforcement by using shape-memory alloy (SMA) as a substitute for traditional rebar. SMA reinforced concrete (SMARC) provides self-healing capabilities, improving durability and longevity while reducing maintenance costs.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The SMARC uses Nitinol, a Nickel-Titanium shape-memory alloy, as the reinforcing component. Nitinol, when deformed at lower temperatures, remembers its original shape and returns to it when heated. SMARC comprises 30% Nitinol and 70% standard concrete mixture. Threads and hooks on Nitinol rebar ensure firm adhesion to the concrete matrix. This composition is designed to create a memory effect within the concrete structure, allowing it to return to its original form after deformation.

The Nitinol rebar acts in unison with the concrete mix, with the Nitinol alloy measuring 0.5cm in diameter and spaced at 10cm intervals throughout the concrete mix. The strength of the Nitinol alloy allows it to be utilized efficiently in smaller diameters compared to traditional steel rebar, reducing the overall weight of the structure and material costs.

CLAIMS:
1. Use of Nitinol as the reinforcing component within the concrete mix provides a self-healing capability, allowing the concrete to revert to its original form after deformation.
2. Reduced material costs and weight due to the smaller diameter of Nitinol, maintaining strength and durability equivalent to or better than traditional steel reinforcement.
3. The intrinsic properties of Nitinol, such as its resistance to corrosion and superelasticity, improve the overall longevity and durability of the structure, reducing maintenance costs over time.
4. The spacing and diameter of Nitinol rebar can be adjusted based on the specific needs of the structure, providing flexibility in design and application.
 
ENABLEMENT: 
Step 1: Choose the Nitinol alloy (Nickel-Titanium) as the reinforcing material.
Step 2: Prepare the Nitinol rebar by shaping it into the required form, applying threads and hooks for firm adhesion to the concrete matrix.
Step 3: Space the Nitinol rebar at 10cm intervals within the concrete mold.
Step 4: Pour the standard concrete mixture into the mold, ensuring complete coverage of the Nitinol rebar.
Step 5: Allow the concrete to cure, solidifying the mixture while the Nitinol rebar adheres to the concrete matrix.
Step 6: Monitor and control the temperature during curing to ensure the Nitinol maintains its shape memory properties.
Step 7: Test the finished product for deformation and recovery capabilities, making sure the Nitinol successfully imparts the shape memory effect to the concrete structure.
