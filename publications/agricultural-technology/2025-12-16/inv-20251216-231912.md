TITLE: Agro-Copter: Autonomous Crop Analyzing Drone

ABSTRACT: Agro-Copter is an advanced agricultural drone utilizing hyperspectral imaging technology and AI for crop monitoring and analysis. It continuously scans the crop field and provides real-time data on crop health, hydration levels, and pest invasion.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION: Agro-Copter is a quadcopter-style drone having dimensions of 1m x 1m x 0.5m, and made from lightweight high-strength polymer. It carries a compact hyperspectral camera, which captures light from the electromagnetic spectrum. This enables the drone to identify issues like crop diseases or pest infestations at early stages by detecting slight changes in plant reflectance. 

The drone is powered by a lithium-ion battery, enabling it to fly for 2 hours on a single charge. It incorporates an onboard AI model that processes the hyperspectral images real-time, eliminating the need for the time-consuming post-flight image-processing. The AI algorithm has been trained on thousands of plant images, helping it recognize different plant diseases, pest infestations, and water stress levels.

The drone communicates wirelessly with a base station, using an extended-range Wi-Fi module, transmitting data in real-time. The base station, connected to a computer, uses a specially developed software interface to present the analyzed data in an understandable format to the farmer.

CLAIMS:
1. The integration of hyperspectral imaging technology with a drone, allowing detailed and extensive monitoring of crop fields.
2. Onboard AI for real-time image processing, providing immediate feedback about the crop health status.
3. A comprehensive software interface that presents complex hyperspectral data in a simple, understandable format to the farmer.

ENABLEMENT:
Firstly, to build an Agro-Copter, a quadcopter drone is constructed using lightweight and high-strength polymer for an optimal trade-off between durability and flight time. A compact hyperspectral camera is then installed on the drone, designed to capture light across the electromagnetic spectrum.

Following this, an AI model is loaded onto the drone's onboard computer. This model should have been trained using thousands of plant images, to enable it to detect different diseases, pest infestations, and hydration levels of the crops.

An extended-range Wi-Fi module is retained for communication between the drone and the base station. The base station is then connected to a computer using a standard USB cable.

The custom software interface is then installed on the computer. This software interprets the data received from the drone and presents it in a format that's easily understandable to the farmers. Now the drone is ready for deployment. 

Once the drone is operational, it should continuously fly over the crop fields, scanning the crops with its hyperspectral camera. The captured images are then processed by the onboard AI, which detects any signs of plant diseases or pest infestations, and transmits this data in real-time to the base station. The farmer can then use the information presented on the software interface to make informed decisions about crop watering, pesticide application, etc.
